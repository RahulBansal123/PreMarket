<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

#### Make sure you are on Polygon testnet for the DApp to work correctly.

PreMarket is the most trusted decentralized information market platform where you can bet on highly-debated topics and earn for being right.

Users can vote on highly debated topics with their PRE tokens and visualze the other people's bet from the well-designed graphs, market data which includes total volume of the market, total Upvotes volume, total downvotes value etc.

PreMarket utilises the lightening fast and minimal gas fees network of polygon to connect with its smart contracts to store the data of all the votes placed by the users and the data of the markets created by the admin in a decentralized manner.

The PreMarket website is currently hosted on Fleek.

Contracts are deployed at: <br/>
